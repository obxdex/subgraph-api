## Example Queries
Here is a sample GraphQL query that retrieves the latest 10 trades of the trading pair ETH-USDC:
```
query {
  trades(first: 10, orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc) {
    id
    otype
    price
    timestamp
    transactionHash
    userFill
    userFilled
    volumeInQuote
  }
}

```
The following is an example query that returns the total volume traded in a OBX exchange pair in the last 24 hours:
```
query {
  info(id: "01") {
    last24HourVolume
  }
}
```
